# Professional Bounce Indicator - Smart Money Edition

## üéØ Overview

2. **RSI Oversold** - Technical oversold condition with momentum shift
3. **Volume Spike** - Institutional volume activity
4. **Bullish Reversal Pattern** - Hammer, engulfing, or doji patterns
5. **Support Level** - Price at historical support zones  
6. **Market Structure** - Favorable trend context

### 4. **Professional Visualization**
- **Order Blocks**: Green/red boxes showing institutional zones
- **Liquidity Zones**: Yellow dashed lines at equal highs/lows
- **Support Levels**: Gray plots showing key bounce areas
- **Signal Table**: Real-time confluence factor status
